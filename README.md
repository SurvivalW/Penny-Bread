## How to set up MySQL and Dbeaver

Links: 
- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
- https://dbeaver.io/download/

Download and install MySQL and DBeaver database system using the given above links. Each installation is to be configured with the basic pre-configured set up. When access controls are being displayed the username is supposed to be "root" and the password is to be set as "password" in order to access and connect the MySQL server. The port of the server is to be set at 3307 to be connected. 

Once, the MySQL is connected, we connect the database to the DBeaver by setting up a new local host connection and connecting it with the MySQL server by entering the above username, password, and local port connection. Once the setup is done the refresh the connection by right clicking the local host connection.
